#  Age and Gender Challenge üë∂üë¶üë© ‚Äç

## The challenge

Design and train efficient and lightweight algorithms to estimate Age and Gender using facial crop.

## Technologies

The script should be implemented in Python3

You can use machine learning libraries such as

* Tensorflow & Keras
* Pytorch
* Mxnet
* Scikit-learn

The project code should be committed to this git repository.

Please create a requirements.txt file with all the libraries and the packages
you need to run your code. 
If you set it up with a docker or a conda environement, that's even better.
You should also provide the training code and the models.
